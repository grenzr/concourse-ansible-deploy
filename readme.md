## Concourse on Ubuntu 1404 with Vagrant + Ansible

Installs [Concourse CI](http://concourse.ci/) from [binaries](https://github.com/vito/concourse-bin), Nginx, Postgresql using docker
and configures upstart jobs. Ubuntu 1404 uses Vivid's kernel to reach the minimum 3.19 version required by Concourse.

### Prerequisites

1. Ansible 1.9 or higher is required
2. Vagrant (and Virtualbox, or an AWS account and vagrant-aws plugin installed)

### Configuration
1. Rename `vars/credential.sample.yml` into `credential.yml` and update vars with your passwords
2. Create `files` folder and put your private keys there, as described [here](https://github.com/vito/concourse-bin#prerequisites)
3. Install ansible-galaxy dependencies (docker install & firewall install) `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.txt -f`

### Virtualbox

```
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
```

Concourse should be available on http://192.168.66.66

### AWS

In AWS, create/note the keypair to be used on the machine, and if you haven't already created a security group with inbound port 80 allow from wherever you need, do that too and note the `sg-xxxxxx` id for later. If you're deploying into a VPC, note down the subnet id to be deployed into.

Using an elastic IP is recommended (allocate one in AWS and note its address). Create a Route53 record for Concourse to use with that elastic IP. Update the `nginx_server_name` value in `vars/credentials.yml` with this DNS address before you deploy.

Ensure the required environment variables listed below are set (and override any optional ones) :

| Environment Variable  | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| CC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  | None (required) |
| CC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  | None (required) |
| CC_AWS_KEYPAIR |  concourse |
| CC_AWS_AMI | ami-6177f712 (Ubuntu 1404 in eu-west-1) |
| CC_AWS_INSTANCE_TYPE | t2.small |
| CC_AWS_SUBNET_ID | None (set if you're using in a VPC) |
| CC_AWS_EIP | None (required) |
| CC_AWS_SEC_GRP | None (required) |
| CC_AWS_REGION | eu-west-1 |
| CC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH | None (required) |

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
vagrant up --provider=aws
```

After the machine has been created, and Ansible has finished deploying you're all set.
